# Metabolomics 2019: Multi-Omics Integration and System Metabolomics

For this tutorial, we will be covering three workflows: 1) Metabolomics + Microbiome Data Integration, 2) Metabolomics + Transcriptomics Data Integration, and 3) Systems Metabolomics. Details for each workflow are below.

## 1) Metabolomics + Microbiome Data Integration

For this workflow, users will first need to download the example data [here](https://github.com/xia-lab/Metabolomics2019/blob/master/crc_data_june23.zip).

The aim of this workflow is to perform statistical analysis and data integration on a subset of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples from a recent paper by [Yachida et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0458-7). The data consists of shotgun metagenomic + targeted metabolomic analysis of fecal metabolome samples of 149 healthy subjects and 68 stage 3 or 4 CRC patients. First begin by performing shotgun data analysis to obtain a list of significantly enriched KOs [download ppt here](https://github.com/xia-lab/Metabolomics2019/blob/master/SDP_microbiomeanalyst.pptx). Then use MetaboAnalyst to identify the metabolomic CRC signnature [download ppt here](https://github.com/xia-lab/Metabolomics2019/blob/master/targeted_metabolomics_metaboanalyst.pptx). Then perform multi-omics data integration using the Network Explorer module within MetaboAnalyst.

## 2) Metabolomics + Transcriptomics Data Integration

For this workflow, users will first need to download the example data [here](https://github.com/xia-lab/Metabolomics2019/blob/master/breast_cancer.zip).

## 3) Systems Metabolomics

For this workflow, users will first need to download the example data [here](https://github.com/xia-lab/Metabolomics2019/blob/master/ibd_data_june23.zip).
